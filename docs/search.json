    "text": "Welcome to the University of Glasgow Computational Biology Hackathon. \nAre you passionate about unravelling the mysteries of life through code and data? Do you dream of collaborating with brilliant minds to tackle complex biological problems? Look no further! Our exclusive hackathon is designed for researchers, students, and enthusiasts who share a common goal: advancing computational biology.\nSign Up Here!\n\n\n\nDate: 12th-14th June, 2024\nTime: 10am-4pm\nLocation: McMillan Round Reading Room, Main Campus, University Avenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterdisciplinary Exploration: Dive into the intersection of biology, computer science, and big data analysis.\nNetworking: Connect with fellow researchers and forge collaborative relationships across the University.\nChallenging Problems: We have curated an exciting range of projects with associated data. Choose your challenge!\nSkill Enhancement: Learn new coding and data handling skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nPostgrads: Whether you’re a Masters or a PhD candidate, this hackathon is your chance to apply computational techniques to real-world biological questions.\nResearchers: Join forces with fellow scientists to crack complex problems. Collaborate, brainstorm, and innovate!\nPIs: Share your expertise and mentor the next generation of computational biologists.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment of a compact and concurrently accessible open-source standard file format for pyramidal whole slide pathology Images to facilitate AI training.\n\nProject lead: Chris Walsh (c.walsh@crukscotlandinstitute.ac.uk)\nAdvances in digital pathology have revolutionised the field but resulted has in the challenge of managing vast amounts of data. However, whole slide imaging scanners output the data in proprietary formats which often lack accessibility and flexibility. To address the issue here we propose building a new open source pyramidal file format.\nMore information about this project can be found here.\n\nHGP-LASAGNE: Resolving histopathological growth patterns in colorectal–liver metastasis into layers of spatial heterogeneity\n\nProject lead: Tengyu Zhang (t.zhang.6@research.gla.ac.uk)\nColorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant global health challenge, ranking as the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. There is a critical need to understand the metastatic processes and imaging based spatial transcriptomics offers this unique opportunity. The goal of the hackathon is to analyse unpublished spatial transcriptomics data from Jamieson Spatial Lab.\nMore information about this project can be found here.\nPlease note that you will have to sign a data sharing/protection declaration before starting work on this project.\n\nHost-Pathogen Extractor: Using text mining, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning to automate database creation for infectious disease research and surveillance\n\nProject Lead: Max Farrel (maxwell.farrell@glasgow.ac.uk)\nLarge scale databases of host-pathogen interactions underlie models that predict future emerging infectious disease threats, and guide surveillance of cross-species pathogens. As the number of papers increases exponentially, automated ways of extracting this information should be considered, however those have been rare in ecology. As part of this project, the hackathon teams will explore different ways of extracting host-pathogen interactions from abstracts, from traditional pattern matching to applying large language models.\nMore information about this project can be found here.\n\nThe FAIR Data Pipeline: Provenance driven data management\n\nProject lead: Ryan Field (ryan.field@glasgow.ac.uk)\nTo address the issues of FAIR and traceable data and models, the FAIR data pipeline was developed. It is available for various programming languages and is continuously developed by a very small team. The project would greatly benefit from further testing, bug fixing and tutorials. During the Hackathon we hope that team members can test the pipeline on their own real world data and help improve the user experience and documentation.\nMore information about this project can be found here.\n\nDevelopment of an iCLIP2 data analysis tool, mapping protein footprints on RNA.\n\nDevelopment of a pipeline with a web interface for iCLIP data analysis to allow researchers to upload sequencing data along with required parameters and necessary files for their analysis.\nMore information to follow!\n\n\n\nQ1: I want to participate but worried about my coding skills/AI knowledge/etc?\nA1: Hackathons are a great environment to learn, so don’t worry, just be upfront with your team lead. You can still contribute in so many ways, like ideas, writing, biological knowledge, management, etc.\nQ2: I can only attend 2 out of the 3 days. Is this a problem?\nA2: While attending the full duration of the Hackathon would be beneficial, we understand that committing 3 days might be difficult for some. Please include that information in your application form.\nQ3: I am a master student and worried about my skills suitability.\nA3: See Q1. We welcome participants from diverse backgrounds and you can contribute in many different ways. Also, please note that most projects require initial preparation before the Hackathon.\nQ4: What if I don’t know any other participants?\nA4: This is a great opportunity to get to know people from across the university! You don’t need to have spoken to anyone prior to signing up, just fill out the sign-up form and you will be made very welcome.\nQ5: Will I definitely be included in the team for my preferred project?\nA5: We aim to offer every participant a spot on their preferred team but this may not be possible if a project is oversubscribed. This is why we ask you to rank projects by preference on the sign-up form. If there is a project you don’t want to be considered for, please indicate this on the form.\n\n\n\nReady to embark on this scientific adventure?

    "text": "Dr Catalina Vallejos is a Group Leader at the MRC Human Genetics Unit and a Turing Fellow.\n\nResearch in a Nutshell \nWhile biomedical data sometimes classifies as “big data” (where the number of samples and/or variables is large), complexity is its most prominent feature. This arises from a combination of different sources of heterogeneity: heterogeneity across individuals in a population (e.g. response to treatment), heterogeneity in terms of the type of data we collect (e.g. health records & genomics) and heterogeneity that is introduced by the data collection process (e.g. measurement error).\nWe focus on the development of novel statistical methodology to address and study these sources of heterogeneity. This is a highly multidisciplinary task: from the understanding of complex biomedical problems and technologies, to the development of new methodology and the implementation of open-source analysis tools. Our current research focuses on two areas of application. Firstly, single-cell RNA-sequencing, a cutting-edge experimental technique that allows genome-wide quantification of gene expression on a cell-by-cell basis. Secondly, electronic health records research, to develop predictive models based on observational data that is routinely collected by health providers (e.g. NHS). Developing computational tools that can make full advantage of the rich information provided by these data sources is ought to improve our understanding of health and disease, playing an important role in precision medicine initiatives."

Johnston Centre for Cancer Research (PGJCCR), Queen’s University Belfast and a Group Leader at the CRUK Scotland Institute in Glasgow.\nMolecular Pathology and Tumour Signalling in Early Disseminating Colorectal Cancer (CRC)\nCRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world and is the second highest cause of cancer-related death in Europe. This is mainly due to the ineffectiveness of current chemotherapy treatments for late stage and advanced metastatic disease. Despite advances in our understanding of the biology of these tumours, there have been disappointingly few advances in CRC therapy in the last 20 years. Recent work has highlighted the importance of the chemical messages that arise from cells that support the tumour (tumour microenvironment), yet current understanding of CRC is based largely on the epithelial tumour cells themselves. The Molecular Pathology Research Group is focused on investigating mechanisms underlying disease progression in CRC, with a particular interest in understanding the crosstalk between tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment associated with early dissemination of tumour cells. The research programme also includes development of molecular subtypes, using signalling associated with intrinsic (epithelial) and extrinsic (stromal and immune) components of the tumour."

    "text": "Dr Rona Strawbridge is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Health & Wellbeing at the University of Glasgow.\n\nResearch\nPeople with serious mental illness (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder) have an increased incidence of cardiometabolic disease (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease) compared to the general population, however the reasons for this are poorly understood. It is possible that there are common biological mechanisms for both mental and physical traits. If so, some medications currently used for cardiometabolic disorders could be repurposed to improve mental health and reduce long-term complications in those with serious mental illness.\nI aim to investigate whether common biological mechanisms underlie physical and mental illness by:\n\nExploring the genetic basis of serious mental illness, using cross-diagnostic traits associated with psychiatric diseases (following the research domain criteria (RDoC) approach)\nAssessing the impact of genetic susceptibility to serious mental illness on cardiometabolic traits.\nUsing genetics to improve prediction of risk, severity and outcomes in serious mental illness."

    "text": "Magnus Rattray is a Professor of Computational & Systems Biology and Director of the Institute for Data Science & Artificial Intelligence of the University of Manchester. He is also a Turing Fellow.\n\nBiography\n2012 - Present: Professor of Computational and Systems Biology, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester\n2010 - 2012: Professor of Statistical Bioinformatics and Machine Learning, Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience and Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield\n1998 - 2010: Lecturer and Senior Lecturer in Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester\n1996 - 1998: EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Associate, Neural Computing Research Group, Department of Applied Mathematics, Aston University\n1993-1996: PhD Computer Science, University of Manchester\n1989-1992: BSc (1st class hons) Mathematics and Physics, University of Manchester\n\n\nResearch interests\nMy group works on how to learn models and make inferences given evidence from high-throughput biological datasets. The models that we develop range from mechanistic differential equation models of the cell to more abstract probabilistic latent variable models that can be used uncover interesting structure in high-dimensional data. We are particularly interested in hybrid models that combine aspects of mechanistic and probabilistic models.\nModels encode our hypotheses about how biological systems work. We use probabilistic inference to learn the model parameters and to choose between competing models so as to identify the hypotheses best supported by the available experimental evidence. Bayesian inference and non-parametric modelling is a particular focus as this provides a principled framework for dealing with uncertainty in complex systems. We are applying our methods to infer gene regulatory networks from time-series mRNA expression and DNA-protein binding data, to uncover changes in the transcriptome from RNA-Seq datasets, and to develop novel inference algorithms for time-series data analysis and systems biology modelling.\n\n\nOverview\nBiology has become a data-rich science. Modern high-throughput experimental techniques can make simultaneous measurements of vast numbers of biological molecules and their interactions. These measurements can be taken at different times during some biological process, resulting in time-series data. My research group works on the interpretation of these datasets by building predictive models of biological systems using computer algorithms. We have developed methods to uncover the patterns underlying gene expression changes in time and to uncover the complex network of molecular interactions between DNA and proteins which regulate this process. We are also interested in how biological systems change and adapt over much longer evolutionary time-scales using phylogenetic models."
