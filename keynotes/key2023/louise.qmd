Louise Matthews is a Professor of Infections Disease Ecology at the School of Biodiversity, One health & Veterinary Medicine at the University of Glasgow.

# Research in a Nutshell 

My interests lie in the application of quantitative tools to infectious disease data to understand of host-pathogen systems and inform disease control. Current areas of interest include:

-   The role of individual variability (such as superspreading or genetic predisposition) in disease synamics and control

-   The sources of aggregation in host-parasite systems

-   The mathematics of diversity measures

-   Genetic susceptibility and selective breeding for disease control

-   Game theory and control planning

Current projects and applications in these areas include the transmission and control of E. coli O157 in the cattle reservoir; the role of virulence factors in the epidemiology of non-O157 E. coli; the genetic epidemiology of resistance to sea-lice infection in salmon; the impact of selective breeding on MHC diversity; the identification of sources of aggregation in the sheep-nematode system systems; and the epidemiology and ecology of antimicrobial resistance.
